# About the Role

At HotBeans Website Development, we recognize the power of a well-crafted design to elevate businesses and enhance user experiences. As a Website Design Advisor, you will work directly with clients, the design team, and the development team to ensure that every project aligns with the client's vision and business goals. You will act as a bridge between the creative and technical sides of the process, offering expert advice, recommendations, and strategic insights to guide the direction of each project.

In this part-time, hybrid role, you will have the flexibility to manage your schedule while maintaining a strong connection with our teams and clients. You’ll spend part of your time collaborating in our office, and the rest can be spent working remotely, allowing you to enjoy the balance of both environments.

Your primary responsibility will be to advise on the design strategy, provide feedback on concepts and implementations, and ensure that design principles are adhered to across all stages of the project.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Strategy Development:** Work with the design team to define the overall design strategy for each project, ensuring that it meets client specifications and follows industry best practices.
- **Team Collaboration:** Collaborate closely with the design and development teams to ensure that designs are not only aesthetically pleasing but also feasible to implement and function as intended.
- **Design Review & Feedback:** Review design mock-ups, prototypes, and final implementations, providing constructive feedback and suggesting improvements to ensure the highest quality of work.
- **Trend Analysis:** Stay informed about the latest design trends, tools, and technologies, advising the team on innovations that could enhance our projects.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure that designs are implemented according to the set guidelines and standards, and that the final product aligns with the original concept.

## Qualifications

- **Consulting Experience:** Previous experience in a design advisory, consultancy, or similar role, where strategic input was provided across design and development projects.
- **UI/UX Understanding:** Strong knowledge of user interface and user experience design principles, including usability, accessibility, and interaction design.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Familiarity with project management and communication tools such as Slack, Trello, or Asana to keep all stakeholders aligned and informed.
- **Wireframing & Prototyping:** Experience with wireframing and prototyping tools like InVision or Adobe XD to communicate design concepts effectively.

### Personal Attributes

- **Problem-Solving:** The ability to identify design challenges and provide practical, effective solutions that benefit both the client and the development team.
- **Communication Skills:** Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to clearly articulate design decisions to clients, teams, and stakeholders.
- **Advisory Mindset:** A strong ability to listen, advise, and guide clients while balancing their needs with design best practices.
- **Leadership & Collaboration:** Ability to lead design discussions, provide guidance, and work effectively with a team of creative professionals and developers.
- **Time Management:** Strong time management skills to handle multiple client accounts and projects while maintaining high-quality work and meeting deadlines.

### Experience

- **Professional Background:** 3+ years of experience in a design or advisory role, preferably in a consultancy or client-facing position.
- **Portfolio:** A portfolio that demonstrates your ability to guide design strategies, collaborate on projects, and deliver creative solutions that align with business goals.
- **Educational Background:** A degree in Graphic Design, User Experience Design, or a related field is preferred, but not required.

## Perks and Benefits

- **Hybrid Work Arrangement:** Split your time between working remotely and in-office to enjoy a flexible work-life balance.
- **Learning & Development:** Opportunities to attend conferences, workshops, and training sessions to expand your design knowledge and consulting skills.
- **Creative Environment:** Work in a collaborative and innovative environment where your design expertise is valued and encouraged.
