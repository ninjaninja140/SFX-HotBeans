				FrontEnd Developers, Designers and 3D Component Modellers. These people who make up our
				varying Developer teams give HotBeans its spectacular title, recognition and popularity.

				We employ people of any background and any qualifications, to us, your background and
				qualifications do not matter, we employ people based on skill. We believe that ethnicity
				and qualifications define a good developer, but rather their skill and what they can do.
